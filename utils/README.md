# Utils folder 
I created these functions to manipulate project objects like polygons or predictions.

## All the files

- **Poly utils** : Differents functions to manipulate polygons 
- **Prediction utils** : Visualize segmentation mask on an image

*You can watch all the the functions and their utility in their .py file.*
