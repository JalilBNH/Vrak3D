# Metashape class 

I created this class to make the manipulation of metashape project easier 

## How to use the function 
To use this class, you just have to import it into the main and load a project with this function :

```python
from class_metashape import Project
project = Project('path/to/project.psx')
```

*After that you will have access to all the methods and attributes to work on your metashape project.*
